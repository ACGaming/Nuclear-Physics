Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.

Known bugs:
    - Items is not stored in inventory probably using NBT somehow.
        - Stores, but doesn't load it in the right slot.

    - Quantum Assembler render incorrectly.
    - Reactor Cell rendering is messed up.
    - Machine animation continues even if the process is stalled, i.e when there is no more power available.
    - Fluid levels in machines is not always synced properly to the client. (Needs retesting, likely solved).
    - When plasma is released into the world and causes block damage, block change is not properly synced to the client.
    - Electromagnet Glass have wrong material and footstep sound? As well as break sound.

Known features not implemented:
    - Display tooltip to all items.
    - Make slots in machines only accept valid items.
    - Add support for batteries in machines etc.

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Fluid output is not transferred to neighbor machine accepting it as input.
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter.

    Enhancement:
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Make more stuff only server side, if not needed on the client.
        - Add a Geiger counter to measure radiation.
        - Add radiation resistance block which implements IAntiPoisonBlock.
        - Make reactor make glass if sand is next to it, and make it melt snow.
        - Make accelerator GUi show energy usage per 5 mg antimatter, as a measure of efficiency.

    Rendering:
        - Make the whole multiblock reactor cell share GUI.
        - Make nuclear boiler eject steam.
        - Make turbines eject smoke particles?

    Networking:

    Energy:
        Centrifuge:
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Chemical Extractor: (Done)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake

        Nuclear Boiler:
            128 MJ ~= 21000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride

        Turbine:
            Fission Reactor with 4 Control Rods: (Generated from one Turbine)
               (128 MJ * 20) + 90 MJ = 2650 MJ

               60 seconds run = 64 MJ

        Particle Accelerator:
            5 mg antimatter (One particle accelerated to 100%) uses 97.85 MJ if inner circle is 100x100 blocks.
