Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.

Known bugs:
    - Quantum Assembler render incorrectly.
    - Items is not stored in inventory probably using NBT somehow.
    - Reactor Cell rendering is messed up.
    - Machine animation continues even if the process is stalled, i.e when there is no more power available.
    - Fluid levels in machines is not always synced properly to the client.

Known features not implemented:
    - Render Electromagnet and Fulmination with connected textures.
    - Display tooltip to all items.
    - More dynamic custom rendering, a interface and a getRenderer() maybe? ConnectedTextureRenderer a candidate?

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Make slots in machines only accept valid items.
        - Fluid output is not transferred to neighbor machine accepting it as input.
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter.

    Enhancement:
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Make more stuff only server side, if not needed on the client.

    Rendering:
        - Make the whole multiblock reactor cell share GUI.
        - Make nuclear boiler eject steam.
        - Make turbines eject smoke particles?

    Networking:
        - Only send PacketTileEntity from server to client? (Done) (Not tested)

    Energy:
        Centrifuge:
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Chemical Extractor: (Done)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake

        Nuclear Boiler:
            128 MJ ~= 21000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride

        Turbine
            Fission Reactor with 4 Control Rods: (Generated from one Turbine)
               (128 MJ * 20) + 90 MJ = 2650 MJ

               60 seconds run = 64 MJ
