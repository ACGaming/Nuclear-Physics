Porting to 1.10.2 from 1.7.10:
    - Fix particle texture when breaking TESR rendered blocks. Only working when facing north. (https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/projecte/models/block/dummy.json)
    - Fix particle texture for every block, and make metadata blocks have different.
    - Render fluid in qui.
    - Fix fire not vanishing after a while. (Seems like fire doesn't persist re-login?)
    - Handle inventory on destruction of block, drop in world or preserve in item block. (MOSTLY DONE, REVIEW...)
    - Check if auto transferring of fluids between machines is working.
    - Make thermometer emit redstone when threshold is reached.
    - Reactor spawning water bubbles even if there is not water adjacent.
    - Fix reactor cell multi block NPE. Happens when trying to save to NBT.

General:

Known bugs:
    - Should not be possible to inject fuel into each of the reactor cell multiblocks...
    - Quantum Assembler render incorrectly.
    - Electromagnet Glass have wrong material and footstep sound? As well as break sound.

Known features not implemented:
    - Add support for batteries in machines etc.

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Fluid output is not transferred to neighbor machine accepting it as input.
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter.
        - Not poison players in creative mode?

    Enhancement:
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Make more stuff only server side, if not needed on the client.
        - Add a Geiger counter to measure radiation.
        - Add radiation resistance block which implements IAntiPoisonBlock.
        - Make reactor make glass if sand is next to it, and make it melt snow.
        - Make accelerator GUI show energy usage per 5 mg antimatter, as a measure of efficiency.
        - Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.
        - Make toxic waste denser than water, so that it is replaced by toxic waste.
        - Add support for vertical particle accelerators.
        - Amplify sirens, with sort of multi block structure, also add pitch support for the multi block.

    Rendering:
        - Make the whole multi block reactor cell share GUI.
        - Make nuclear boiler eject steam.
        - Make turbines eject smoke particles?
        - Render TESR's with FastTESR.

    Networking:
        - Optimize syncing of machines etc, only sync when gui is open etc.

    Energy:
        Chemical Extractor: (Done)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Nuclear Boiler:
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Centrifuge:
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Turbine:
            Fission Reactor with 4 Control Rods: (Generated from one Turbine)
               (128 MJ * 20) + 90 MJ = 2650 MJ

               60 seconds run = 64 MJ

        Particle Accelerator:
            5 mg antimatter (One particle accelerated to 100%) uses 97.85 MJ if inner circle is 100x100 blocks.

            (16.01.27) halvors: Anyone knows how to render obj models in a TESR in 1.10.2? I need to call some code to only render parts of the model. Also groups of the obj file like i could with the AdvancedModelLoader and IModelCustom on 1.7.10, any ideas?

            (16.10.15) ghz|afk: the mod's opensource (MIT or BSD, can't remember which one I used)
            (16.11.06) ghz|afk: this is how I use that helper

            (16.13.30) ghz|afk: so, meh
            (16.13.42) ghz|afk: I was trying out this Open Glider mod that I found on curseforge
            (16.13.45) ghz|afk: it looked interesting
            (16.14.05) ghz|afk: but it's really just a fancy clone of the openblocks one, I was hoping for some elytra-style pitch control
            (16.14.07) ghz|afk: but not even that ;P
            (16.33.47) halvors: ghz|afk: Thanks, but as far i can se do you render the whole model? I need to render just a part of it like i do in 1.7.10 here: https://github.com/halvors/Quantum/blob/master/src/main/java/org/halvors/quantum/client/render/machine/RenderChemicalExtractor.java
            (16.34.07) halvors: You see the renderOnly function? Something like that :)

            (16.53.23) terraflops: Dumb question but I haven't done this in years: I'm trying to put 3 glDisable calls before each player gets rendered and then glEnable right after. Do I use RenderPlayerEvent.Pre and Post?
            (16.55.42) ghz|afk: halvors: well, there's a visibility groups thing
            (16.55.47) ghz|afk: but I don't really know how to use it myself
            (16.55.57) ghz|afk: it IS possible though
            (16.56.04) ghz|afk: I just don't have example code for it
            (16.58.02) TechnicianLP: are server-stateevents triggered on client when a player connects to a dedicated server?
            (17.00.42) halvors: ghz|afk: Where do you know about this from? Any source i might be interested in?
            (17.01.06) halvors: ghz|afk: Does it allow you to select out the barts based on string names as i showed you from 1.7.10?
            (17.01.19) ghz|afk: yes
            (17.01.33) ghz|afk: you may need to read the source code of the objmodel stuff
            (17.01.47) ghz|afk: I know this because I was here on IRC when the person who wrote that code was explaining it
            (17.01.59) ghz|afk: I just prefer to keep the pieces separate
            (17.02.04) ghz|afk: and draw them together on demand
            (17.02.09) ghz|afk: rather than have one big complex model
            (17.02.15) ghz|afk: and hide parts of it
            (17.04.52) ghz|afk: halvors: https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.12.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/client/model/obj/OBJModel.java#L1110
            (17.05.07) halvors: ghz|afk: Thanks, you would prefer just creating another modelHandle object and render them from different obj files?
            (17.05.08) ghz|afk: see that OBJState? it has a map for visible groups
            (17.05.31) ghz|afk: well that's the thing
            (17.05.40) ghz|afk: you WILL have to bake() multiple IBakedModels
            (17.05.45) ghz|afk: with the different visibility groups
            (17.05.51) ghz|afk: so it's up to you
            (17.06.08) ghz|afk: if you split them up into separate files, you will have to draw more than once
            (17.06.29) ghz|afk: if you don't, you may have more combinations to bake

            (17.07.05) Raycoms: protected void onContentsChanged(final int slot) is there a way to get more information about what exactly changed?
            (17.07.12) ghz|afk: will give your an IBakedModel with only Part1, Part2, and Part3 enabled
            (17.07.32) ghz|afk: Raycoms: no
            (17.07.41) halvors: ghz|afk: Thanks, will try that out :) But the code seems to be deprecated?
            (17.08.00) ghz|afk: yes but eh...
            (17.08.11) ghz|afk: it's deprecated in favor of using custom data from the blockstates json
            (17.08.27) ghz|afk: which can be used to declare visibility sets
            (17.08.36) ghz|afk: and activate each set from different blockstates and such
            (17.08.47) halvors: oh.
            (17.08.53) ghz|afk: but you asked about rendering on a TESR so I answered for that ;P
            (17.09.19) Raycoms: Does this method get called regularly or only if a real interaction happened? (Does chunkload trigger it p.e)
            (17.09.41) ghz|afk: look for usages?
            (17.09.58) halvors: ghz|afk: Thanks :)
