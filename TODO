Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.

New features to add:
    - Make nuclear boiler eject steam.

Known bugs:
    - Shift clicking item into Nuclear Boiler causes crash. (Obfuscated)
    - Quantum Assembler render incorrectly. (De-obfuscated)
    - Block rotation on placement is messed up when player is facing east on block placement. (De-obfuscated)
    - Items is not stored in inventory probably using NBT somehow.

Networking:
    - Only send PacketTileEntity from server to client?

Implement energy systems:
    Centrifuge:
        128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

    Chemical Extractor: (Done)
        128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake

    Nuclear Boiler:
        128 MJ ~= 21000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride

    Turbine
        Fission Reactor with 4 Control Rods:
           (128 MJ * 20) + 90 MJ = 2650 MJ
