General:
    - Fix particle texture when breaking TESR rendered blocks. Only working when facing north. (https://github.com/sinkillerj/ProjectE/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/projecte/models/block/dummy.json)
    - Fix particle texture for every block, and make metadata blocks have different.
    - Fix fire not vanishing after a while. (Seems like fire doesn't persist re-login?)
    - Handle inventory on destruction of block, drop in world or preserve in item block. (MOSTLY DONE, REVIEW...)
    - Make sure that block is dropped when destroyed in survival mode.
    - Fix reactor cell multi block NPE. Happens when trying to save to NBT.
    - Check if auto transferring of fluids between machines is working.
    - Make boiling water spawn particle rate based in the temperature.

    - Debug and sort out how reactor multi-blocks actually work.
    - Make sure only one tile entity in the multi-block structure is running at the same time.
    - Slow down client side temperature update of reactor cell?

    - Fix that fuel is not recognized in the OreDictionaryHelper.
    - Fix antimatter explosion not spawning particles. (Client-side smoke)
    - Fluid output is not transferred to neighbor machine accepting it as input.
    - Why is electricity not generated during the night? Temperature is lower at night?

Known bugs:
    - Should not be possible to inject fuel into each of the reactor cell multiblocks...
    - Quantum Assembler render incorrectly.

Known features not implemented:

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter.
        - Not poison players in creative mode?
        - Implement IAntiPoisonBlock and add make radiation resistant blocks.

    Enhancement:
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Make more stuff only server side, if not needed on the client.
        - Add a Geiger counter to measure radiation.
        - Add radiation resistance block which implements IAntiPoisonBlock. (Raytrace)
        - Make reactor make glass if sand is next to it, and make it melt snow.
        - Make accelerator GUI show energy usage per 5 mg antimatter, as a measure of efficiency.
        - Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.
        - Make toxic waste denser than water, so that it is replaced by toxic waste.
        - Add support for vertical particle accelerators.
        - Amplify sirens, with sort of multi block structure, also add pitch support for the multi block.
        - Add metal break sound to machines etc?
        - Add thorium fuel?
        - Add plasma decay event?
        - Add auto update support (https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/autoupdate/)

    Rendering:
        - Make the whole multi block reactor cell share GUI.
        - Make nuclear boiler eject steam.
        - Render TESR's with FastTESR?

    Networking:
        - Optimize syncing of machines etc, only sync when gui is open etc.

    Energy:
        Chemical Extractor: (Done)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Nuclear Boiler:
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Centrifuge:
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Particle Accelerator:
            5 mg antimatter (One particle accelerated to 100%) uses 97.85 MJ if inner circle is 100x100 blocks.

        Fulmination Generator:
            125mg antimatter = 24.93 MJ
            1g antimatter = ?
