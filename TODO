Known bugs:
    Before Beta release:
        - Make sure that block is dropped when destroyed in survival mode.
        - Handle inventory on destruction of block, drop in world or preserve in item block. (MOSTLY DONE, REVIEW...

    Low Priority:
        - Fluid output is not transferred to neighbor machine accepting it as input.
        - Slow down client side temperature update of reactor cell?
        - Fix fire not vanishing after a while. (Seems like fire doesn't persist re-login?)
        - Reactors are only running when first opening GUI on world load. (NOT CONFIRMED)
        - Check if we should have a uranium hexaflouride container for gas centrifuge and nuclear boiler.

    High Priority:
        - When in GUI when a machines is removed, or a reactor explode. It fetches name from the new block.
        - Why is electricity not generated during the night? Temperature is lower at night?
        - Fix antimatter explosion not spawning particles. (Client-side smoke) (Is this because it's only called from the server?)
        - Fluids renders strangely in world.
        - When other mods fluids is used as default, tanks still contain the old one.

        - Verify the breeding process.
            - Should breeding reactors only create heat when actually enriched uranium is present in the middle?

        - Implement inventory in plasma heater, so that player can inject cells into tanks.
        - Implement inventory automation for all machines.
        - Implement support for other mods wrenches. (DONE: Mekanism)

        - Verify that energy in plasma heater is actually displayed in the hovering text.

Known features not implemented:

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter.
        - Not poison players in creative mode?
        - Implement IAntiPoisonBlock and add make radiation resistant blocks.
        - Add handheld thermometer? (From old atomic science).

    Enhancement:
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Make more stuff only server side, if not needed on the client.
        - Add a Geiger counter to measure radiation.
        - Add radiation resistance block which implements IAntiPoisonBlock. See EntityLivingBase.canEntityBeSeen()
        - Make reactor make glass if sand is next to it, and make it melt snow.
        - Make accelerator GUI show energy usage per 5 mg antimatter, as a measure of efficiency.
        - Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.
        - Make toxic waste denser than water, so that it is replaced by toxic waste.
        - Add support for vertical particle accelerators.
        - Amplify sirens, with sort of multi block structure, also add pitch support for the multi block.
        - Add metal break sound to machines etc?
        - Add thorium fuel?
        - Add plasma decay event?
        - Add auto update support (https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/autoupdate/)
        - Make boiling water spawn particle rate based in the temperature. (https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/17620/equation-to-make-small-number-big-and-big-number-small-gravity)
        - Add thermal capability that can be applied to tile entities.
        - Use mekanism better performance redstone checks?

    Rendering:
        - Render only moving parts in TESR's?

    Networking:
        - Optimize syncing of machines etc, only sync when gui is open etc.

    Energy:
        Chemical Extractor: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Gas Centrifuge: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Nuclear Boiler: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Particle Accelerator: (DONE)
            5 mg antimatter (One particle accelerated to 100%) uses 97.85 MJ if inner circle is 100x100 blocks.

        Plasma Heater: (DONE)
            4 x 128MJ ~= 80000 = 2000 mB

        Quantum Assembler: (TODO)

        Fulmination Generator: (TODO)
            125mg antimatter = 24.93 MJ
            1g antimatter = ?
